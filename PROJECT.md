## Architecture Components

### Infrastructure (CDK)
- **Location**: `infra/`
- **Purpose**: AWS CDK infrastructure as code
- **Components**: DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM roles
- **Technology**: TypeScript, AWS CDK v2

### API Service (Lambda)
- **Location**: `services/api/`
- **Purpose**: REST API handlers for issue management
- **Components**: Lambda functions, API endpoints
- **Technology**: TypeScript, AWS Lambda, API Gateway

### Shared Package
- **Location**: `packages/shared/`
- **Purpose**: Common utilities, types, and constants
- **Components**: Shared types, utility functions
- **Technology**: TypeScript

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint with TypeScript rules
- Prettier for code formatting
- Conventional commits

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for Lambda functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Local testing with simulated events
- CDK synthesis validation

### Deployment
- AWS CDK for infrastructure
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Environment-specific configurations
- Security best practices
